        1950s. In 1955, the All Caps Didot font, 
        named after brothers Firmin and Pierre Didot 
        (highly renowned printers, publishers, inventors,
        typeface designers, and intellectuals between the 18th and 19th century), 
        became a permanent logo on Vogue magazine's cover.
        Vogue Magazine's logo has advanced in recent years,
        but its look is still based on Didone font styles.
        Didone fonts were developed by Firmin Didot, 
        Giambattista Bodoni and Justus Erich Walbaum, 
        whose iconic typefaces, Bodoni, Didot, and Walbaum, 
        remain in use today.
